    <h1>About Albany</h1>
        <p>Lark Street, which runs through the center of downtown, is dotted with galleries, small shops, churches, and wine stores selling old wines from New York state. First Fridays, a monthly celebration of the arts and culture, are held in Albany. Free admission is provided by galleries, such as those on Lark Street, and local businesses give special discounts to guests. Even with all the snow, locals don't hibernate over the winter. Albany is known for its hockey culture, and ice skaters are frequently spotted spinning around the Empire Skate Plaza, which is located at the foot of the famous Egg. Built in the 1970s, this oddly shaped building serves as the area's cultural venue for ballet, theater, and other acts.</p>
